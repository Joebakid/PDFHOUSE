# 📘 PDF-House: Departmental Course Material Viewer

Welcome to **PDF-House**, an open-source academic tool built to help students access, organize, and view course materials effortlessly — from **anywhere** and on **any device**.

---

## ✨ About the Project

This platform was created as a **legacy project** — a gift to future students and departments — with the vision of providing **easy, centralized, and remote access to academic resources**.

Students can now download lecture notes, assignments, and PDFs structured by **department**, **level**, **semester**, and **subdivision** (where applicable), whether they’re on campus or not.

## 🔧 Customizable by Design

PDF-House was built with **flexibility** in mind:

- You can **add your own PDFs** by simply editing the JSON files in `/src/JSON/...`
- You can customize the **design, structure, and layout** to suit your department's or school's preferences.
- The code is **modular and maintainable**, built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.

Whether you're in Marine Engineering or any other field, adapting this project to your curriculum is straightforward.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

This project is more than just code. It's about **empowerment and accessibility** — giving students the freedom to study and revise anytime, from anywhere, without being limited to printed handouts or a single device.

> “This is my legacy — the ability for any student, present or future, to access academic materials freely, securely, and easily.”
